{"name":"kNN CUDA","tagline":"Fast k nearest neighbor search using GPU","body":"## Presentation\r\n\r\nThe k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search is a problem found in many research and industrial domains such as 3-dimensional object rendering, content-based image retrieval, statistics (estimation of entropies and divergences), biology (gene classification), etc. In spite of some improvements in the last decades, the computation time required by the kNN search still remains the bottleneck of methods based on kNN, especially in high dimensionnal spaces.\r\n\r\nWe propose in this website two GPGPU implementations of the brute-force (exhaustive) kNN search algorithm. These implementations, through the APIs NVIDIA CUDA and NVIDIA CUBLAS, paralellize the kNN search process into the computer graphic card. Thanks to the parallel structure of the GPU and the optimization of the APIs, the proposed implementation appears to be much faster, especially in high dimension and for large dataset, than the celebrated and highly optimized ANN C++ library.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n* [Vincent Garcia](http://www.vincentgarcia.org/)\r\n* [Eric Debreuve](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~debreuve/)\r\n* [Michel Barlaud](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~barlaud/)\r\n\r\n## Source code\r\n\r\nThe provided CUDA code is usable both for C, and Matlab program. Please read the README file to learn how to adapt code. We provide 4 implementations of the kNN search to fit to your needs:\r\n* KNN CUDA — implementation CUDA of the k-nearest neighbor search.\r\n* KNN CUBLAS — implementation CUBLAS of the k-nearest neighbor search. This version is usually faster than KNN CUDA and is based on matrix multiplication to compute the distances between points.\r\n* With indexes — provides for each query point the distances to the k nearest neighbors and the indexes of these neighbors.\r\n* Without indexes — provides for each query point only the distance to the k-th nearest neighbor. This version is faster than the version with indexes because first it uses less memory and second it does not spent time on processing indexes.\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nFollowing the terms of the license below, you need to acknowledge the use of this code.
